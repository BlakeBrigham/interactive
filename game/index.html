            <p>The engine room of the International Space Station has been exploded by sabotage! Your mission is to figure out who sabotaged the International Space Station, Agent. We have three suspects.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>John Doe, American born hero who works in the engine room, but mysteriously left just before it exploded. He claims he saw someone in a white spacesuit leaving the engineroom just before he did.</li>
                <li>Charlie Williamson, British computer tech with a notoriously large and curved <i>nose</i>. He works the deck above the engines, but was found walking away from the scene holding a cup of tea. He claims he was on lunch break, and that right before the explosion the whole deck smelled of baguettes.</li>
                <li>Leon Louis III, French-born captain of the station. He was not found near the scene, but was saw on security tapes entering a storage closet right next to engineering. Investigation shows that inside the closet was wirings and explosive material, as well as the captain's white space suit. The captain claims that he wasn't even near the deck, and that he is obviously being framed!</li>
